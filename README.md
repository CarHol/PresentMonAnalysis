# PresentMonAnalysis
A statistical analysis tool for game benchmarks using [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) and [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy).

## Background
The goal is to enable visual and mathematical analysis of benchmark data generated by [PresentMon](https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon), a tool developed by Intel for collecting frame time data on Windows. PresentMon supports any graphics API (DX, OpenGL, Metal, etc) as well as UWP, so this tool can in principle be used to analyze the performance of a wide range of Windows applications.

PresentMon outputs data in CSV format, either to file or standard output (STDOUT). PresentMonAnalysis is intended to easier gain insights from the generated data using relatively simple tools.

## Output format
This tool uses Bokeh to generate interactive charts in HTML and JS.

## What works
- Histogram view with fixed values (result file path is hard coded, currently to an included example file) representing the relative frequency of FPS values.
- Frametimes plotted against time
- Text box with frame-to-frame statistics (maximum, minimum and average difference in rendering time between two successive frames)

## In progress
- Argument parsing for file input
- Multi-chart view to include a frame time scatter plot
- Multi-file support (appending time stamps)
- In-chart switching between frame times (ms) and frequency (fps)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7
- Numpy
- Bokeh
